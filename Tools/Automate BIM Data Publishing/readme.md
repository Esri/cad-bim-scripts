# Automate BIM Data Publishing
## Introduction
After following the steps in the Jupyter Notebook, you can automate the sharing of building scene layers to ArcGIS Online, minimizing production time with the most up-to-date project data required by the stakeholder.

#### Before you begin

- Ensure that the model(s) are already georeferenced.
- Sign in to an ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise organization.

#### What you need

- The [ArcGIS Notebook](Blog_Automation_BIM_To_BSLPK_1.ipynb) included in this folder.
- ArcGIS Pro 3.4 or later.
