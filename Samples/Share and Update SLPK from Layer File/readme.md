# Share and Update SLPK from Layer File

Using the [ArcPy script](SceneLayers.py) in this folder, you can automate creating a scene layer package, sharing the scene layer, and replacing the existing scene layer with the updated version. 


## Use Case
This one is going to need the story with the train.


## Requirements
- You need a .lyrx file ([how to download a .lyrx file](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/sharing/overview/save-a-layer-file.htm#:~:text=Select%20the%20layer%20or%20table,file%20in%20the%20Contents%20pane.&text=On%20the%20Save%20Layer(s,Click%20Save. )

## How to use the sample.
Download the ArcPy script (link it) in this folder and adjust it as needed. Optionally, download the sample [layer file](Service_Track.lyrx) and [drawing](Zurich_Trainyard.dwg) in this folder to use with the script.
