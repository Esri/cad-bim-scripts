# Share and Update Scene Layer Package from Layer

I think they wanted title to start with share

Using the [ArcPy script](SceneLayers.py) in this folder, you can automate creating a scene layer package, sharing the scene layer, and replacing the existing scene layer with the updated version. 
NOTE THAT DIFF FROM CICI and David somehow. 


## Use Case
This one is going to need the story with the train.


## Requirements
Idk other data or what. Oh that you need a .lyrx. Link to how to do that in case user doesn't know how.

## How to use the sample.
Use the ArcPy script (link it) in this folder. Optionally, download the sample layer file (file path) and drawing (filepath) in this folder to use with the script.
