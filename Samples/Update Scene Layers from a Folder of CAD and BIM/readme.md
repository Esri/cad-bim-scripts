## Use case
GIS analysts working on a project where volumes of CAD and BIM files are regularly changing need to keep the data up to date in a web scene. This ArcPy sample demonstrates updating scene layers from CAD and BIM files stored in a local folder.
 
## Requirements
You must have a folder that contains CAD and/or BIM files.

## Use the sample
